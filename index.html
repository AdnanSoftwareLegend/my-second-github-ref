    <div class="abc">         Cows are large, domesticated mammals known for their gentle nature and their vital role in agriculture and food production. They are primarily herbivores, grazing on grass and other plants, and are a source of milk, which is processed into various dairy products like cheese and butter. Cows also provide meat, and their dung is a valuable fertilizer. In many cultures, cows are revered and even considered sacred.
